        <p class="card-text">Keep communication open and collaborate with teammates through comments and reactions. Choose how you want to stay informed about project updates: emails, the in-app Notification Center, or a Slack channel. Mention your teammate in a discussion to involve them, and subscribe to tasks to get up-to-the-minute issue and article updates. YouTrack allows you to customize the workflows to fit your specific processes; for instance, it is possible to set events in your projects that when triggered will notify specific people.</p>
